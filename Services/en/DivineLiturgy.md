**People:** Amen.

As the Third Antiphon is being sung (with its verses), the Priest and Deacon bow three times before the holy Table. Then the Priest gives the holy Gospel to the Deacon, who kisses the Priest's hand as he receives it, and then circles the holy Table with the Priest following him. Preceded by altar servers holding candles and fans, they exit through the north door for the so-called Small Entrance. When there is no Deacon, the Priest takes the holy Gospel and holds it up in front of his face. When they reach the center of the church, they stop and bow their heads, and the Deacon says in a low voice:

The Small Entrance
Deacon (in a low voice): Let us pray to the Lord. Lord, have mercy.

The Entrance Prayer
Priest (in a low voice): Master, Lord our God, Who has established the orders and hosts of angels and archangels in heaven to minister to Your glory, grant that holy angels may enter with us, that together we may celebrate and glorify Your goodness. For to You belong all glory, honor, and worship, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**Deacon:** Wisdom. Arise.

The Entrance Hymn, or Eisodikon, is chanted by all.

Come, let us worship and bow down before Christ. Save us, O Son of God, risen from the dead (or Who are wondrous in Your saints), we sing to You, Alleluia.

After this, the Dismissal Hymns (Apolytikia) and the Kontakion of the day are chanted.

**Deacon:** Let us pray to the Lord.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

## The Prayer of the Trisagion Hymn
Priest (in a low voice): O Holy God, Who is resting among the holy ones, praised by the Seraphim with the thrice-holy voice, glorified by the Cherubim, and worshiped by every celestial power, You have brought all things into being out of nothing. You have created man according to Your image and likeness and adorned him with all the gifts of Your grace. You give wisdom and understanding to the one who asks, and You overlook not the sinner, but have set repentance as the way of salvation. You have granted us, Your humble and unworthy servants, to stand even at this hour before the glory of Your holy Altar of sacrifice and to offer to You due worship and praise. Master, accept the Trisagion Hymn also from the lips of us sinners, and visit us in Your goodness. Forgive all our voluntary and involuntary transgressions, sanctify our souls and bodies, and grant that we may worship You in holiness all the days of our lives, through the intercessions of the holy Theotokos and of all the saints who have pleased You throughout the ages.

And he intones:

For You, our God, are holy, and to You we offer up glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and forever,

**The Deacon, facing the People:** And to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen. The people then chant the Trisagion Hymn.

Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. (3)

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.

**Deacon:** Dynamis.

**People:** Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.

*The Deacon then addresses the Priest:*

Command, Master.

They proceed to the cathedra (throne on high behind the holy Table), and as they approach, the Priest says:

Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord.

**Deacon:** Master, bless the throne on high.

**Priest:** Blessed are You upon the throne of the glory of Your kingdom, enthroned upon the Cherubim always, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

When the Trisagion Hymn is concluded, the Reader intones the Prokeimenon of the Epistle.

**Deacon:** Let us be attentive.

The Reader intones the verse of the Prokeimenon.

**Deacon:** Wisdom.

The Reader identifies the Epistle reading.

**Deacon:** Let us be attentive.

The Reader reads the specified Apostolic reading.

The Prayer of the Holy Gospel
Priest (in a low voice): Shine in our hearts, O Master Who loves mankind, the pure light of Your divine knowledge, and open the eyes of our mind that we may comprehend the proclamations of Your Gospels. Instill in us also reverence for Your blessed commandments so that, having trampled down all carnal desires, we may lead a spiritual life, both thinking and doing all those things that are pleasing to You. For You, Christ our God, are the illumination of our souls and bodies, and to You we offer up glory, together with Your Father, Who is without beginning, and Your all-holy, good, and life-creating Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

At the conclusion of the Epistle, the Priest blesses the Reader, saying: Peace be with you the reader.

**People:** Glory to You, O Lord, glory to You.

Ιf the following litanies, in italics, are being omitted, proceed to the exclamation following the Second Prayer of the Faithful.

The Deacon offers the Fervent Supplication.

The people respond to each petition with Lord, have mercy. (3)

The Litany of Fervent Supplication
Let us all say with all our soul and with all our mind, let us all say.

Lord almighty, God of our fathers, we pray You, hear us and have mercy.

Have mercy on us, O God, according to Your great mercy, we pray You, hear us and have mercy.

Again we pray for our Archbishop (Name).

Again we pray for our brethren: the priests, the hieromonks, the hierodeacons, the monastics, and all our brotherhood in Christ.

Again we pray for mercy, life, peace, health, salvation, protection, forgiveness, and remission of the sins of the servants of God, all pious Orthodox Christians residing and visiting in this city: the parishioners, the members of the parish council, the stewards, and benefactors of this holy church.

Again we pray for the blessed and ever-memorable founders of this holy church, and for all our fathers and brethren who have fallen asleep before us, who here have been piously laid to their rest, as well as the Orthodox everywhere.

Again we pray for those who bear fruit and do good works in this holy and all-venerable church, for those who labor and those who sing, and for the people here present who await Your great and rich mercy.

The Prayer of Fervent Supplication
Priest (in a low voice): Lord our God, accept this fervent supplication from Your servants, and have mercy on us in accordance with the abundance of Your mercy, and send down Your compassion upon us and upon all Your people who await Your great and rich mercy.

And he exclaims:

For You are a merciful God Who loves mankind, and to You we offer up glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

The Deacon offers the Prayers for the Catechumens.

The people respond to each petition with Lord, have mercy.

The Prayers for the Catechumens
**Deacon:** Catechumens, pray to the Lord.

Let us, the faithful, pray for the catechumens.

That the Lord will have mercy on them.

That He will teach them the word of truth.

That He will reveal to them the gospel of righteousness.

That He will unite them to His holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.

Save them, have mercy on them, help them, and protect them, O God, by Your grace.

Catechumens, bow your heads to the Lord.

The Prayer for the Catechumens
Priest (in a low voice): Lord our God, Who dwells on high and watches over the humble, You sent forth Your only-begotten Son and God, our Lord Jesus Christ, for the salvation of the human race. Look down upon Your servants, the catechumens, who have inclined their necks to You, and grant them at a proper time the baptism of rebirth, the remission of sins, and the garment of incorruption. Unite them to Your holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, and number them among Your chosen flock.

And he exclaims:

So that with us they also may glorify Your most honorable and majestic name, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

**Deacon:** Those who are catechumens, depart; catechumens depart; all those who are catechumens, depart. Let none of the catechumens remain.

The Supplication of the Faithful
**Deacon:** Again and again, in peace, let all of us, the faithful, pray to the Lord.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

**Deacon:** Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and protect us, O God, by Your grace.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

**Deacon:** Wisdom!

The First Prayer of the Faithful
Priest (in a low voice): We give thanks to You, O Lord God of Hosts, Who has made us worthy to stand even now before Your holy Altar of sacrifice and to fall down before You seeking Your compassion for our sins and those committed in ignorance by the people. Accept, O God, our supplication. Make us worthy to offer You prayers, supplications, and bloodless sacrifices for all Your people. By the power of Your Holy Spirit, make us, whom You have appointed to this, Your ministry, free of blame or stumbling and, with the witness of a clear conscience, able to call upon You at every time and in every place, so that, hearing us, You may be merciful to us in the abundance of Your goodness.

And he exclaims:

For to You all glory, honor, and worship are due, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

**Deacon:** Again and again, in peace, let us pray to the Lord.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

**Deacon:** Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and protect us, O God, by Your grace.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

**Deacon:** Wisdom!

The Second Prayer of the Faithful
Priest (in a low voice): Again and countless times we fall down before You, and we implore You, O Good One, Who loves mankind: That You, having regarded our prayer, may cleanse our souls and bodies from every defilement of flesh and spirit, and grant to us to stand before Your holy Altar of sacrifice, free of guilt and condemnation. Grant also, O God, to those who pray with us, progress in life, faith, and spiritual understanding. Grant that they always worship You with awe and love, partake of Your Holy Mysteries without guilt or condemnation, and be deemed worthy of Your celestial Kingdom.

And he exclaims:

That, ever guarded by Your might, we may ascribe glory to You, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

The Great Entrance
**People:** Amen.

The Cherubic Hymn is chanted to the ellipsis:

Let us, who mystically represent the Cherubim and who sing the thrice-holy hymn to the life-creating Trinity, now lay aside every worldly care. So that we may receive the King of all . . .

Deacon (in a low voice): Let us pray to the Lord.

The Prayer of the Cherubic Hymn
Priest (in a low voice): No one bound by carnal desires and pleasures is worthy to approach, draw near, or minister to You, the King of Glory. For to serve You is great and awesome even for the heavenly powers. Yet, because of Your ineffable and immeasurable love for mankind, You impassibly and immutably became man. You, as the Master of all, became our high priest and delivered unto us the sacred service of this liturgical sacrifice without the shedding of blood. Indeed, Lord our God, You alone reign over the celestial and the terrestrial; borne aloft on the cherubic throne, Lord of the Seraphim and King of Israel, the only holy and resting among the holy ones. I now beseech You, Who alone are good and inclined to hear: Look down upon me, Your sinful and unprofitable servant, and cleanse my soul and heart of a wicked conscience; and enable me, by the power of Your Holy Spirit, clothed with the grace of the priesthood, to stand before Your holy Table and celebrate the Mystery of Your holy and pure Body and Your precious Blood. I come before You with my head bowed, and I implore You: Turn not Your face away from me, nor reject me from among Your children, but make me, Your sinful and unworthy servant, worthy to offer these gifts to You. For You are the One Who both offers and is offered, the One Who is received and is distributed, O Christ our God, and to You we offer up glory, with Your Father, Who is without beginning, and Your all-holy and good and life-creating Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

When the people chant So that we may receive the King of all the Deacon and Priest exit the north door preceded by candles and the censer, and when the hymn is paused, they exclaim the following alternately: May the Lord God remember all of us in His Kingdom always, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

(Complete the Cherubic Hymn) Who is invisibly escorted by the angelic hosts. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia.

The Priest then places the holy Chalice on the holy Table. He takes the holy Paten from the hands of the Deacon and places it to the left of the holy Chalice.

The Deacon reverences the right hand of the Priest, exits the holy Altar through the north door, and stands at the usual place, offering the Litany of Completion (Plerotika).

The Litany of Completion
The people respond with Lord, have mercy, after every petition.

**Deacon:** Let us complete our prayer to the Lord.

For the precious Gifts here presented, let us pray to the Lord.

For this holy house and for those who enter it with faith, reverence, and the fear of God, let us pray to the Lord.

For our deliverance from all affliction, wrath, danger, and necessity, let us pray to the Lord.

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and protect us, O God, by Your grace.

The people respond with Grant this, O Lord, after every petition.

That the whole day may be perfect, holy, peaceful, and sinless, let us ask the Lord.

For an angel of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of our souls and bodies, let us ask the Lord.

For pardon and remission of our sins and transgressions, let us ask the Lord.

For that which is good and beneficial for our souls, and for peace for the world, let us ask the Lord.

That we may complete the remaining time of our life in peace and repentance, let us ask the Lord.

And let us ask for a Christian end to our life, peaceful, without shame and suffering, and for a good defense before the awesome judgment seat of Christ.

**Deacon:** Commemorating our most holy, pure, blessed, and glorious Lady, the Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary, with all the saints, let us commend ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

**People:** To You, O Lord.

The Offertory Prayer
Priest (in a low voice): Lord God Almighty, You alone are holy. You accept the sacrifice of praise from those who call upon You with their whole heart, even so, accept from us sinners our supplication, and bring it to Your holy Altar of sacrifice. Enable us to offer You gifts and spiritual sacrifices for our own sins and the failings of Your people. Deem us worthy to find grace in Your sight, that our sacrifice may be well pleasing to You, and that the good Spirit of Your grace may rest upon us and upon these gifts presented and upon all Your people.

And he exclaims:

Through the mercies of Your only-begotten Son, with Whom You are blessed, together with Your all-holy, good, and life-creating Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

**Priest:** Peace be with all.

**People:** And with your spirit.

**Deacon:** Let us love one another, that with oneness of mind we may confess:

**People:** Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Trinity, one in essence and undivided.

The Priest venerates the covered Holy Gifts, saying privately:

I will love you, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my foundation, my refuge, and my deliverer.[^3]

**Deacon:** The doors! The doors! In wisdom, let us be attentive!

The People say:

The Symbol of Our Faith
I believe in one God, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages; Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten, not created, of one essence with the Father, through Whom all things were made. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man. He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; and He rose on the third day, according to the Scriptures. And He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father; He will come again with glory to judge the living and dead. His Kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Creator of life, Who proceeds from the Father, Who together with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, Who spoke through the prophets. In one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the age to come. Amen.

The Holy Anaphora
**Deacon:** Let us stand aright! Let us stand in awe! Let us be attentive, that we may present the Holy Offering in peace.

**People:** A mercy of peace, a sacrifice of praise.

**Priest:** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

**People:** And with your spirit.

**Priest:** Let us lift up our hearts.

**People:** We lift them up to the Lord.

**Priest:** Let us give thanks to the Lord.

**People:** It is proper and right.

Priest (in a low voice): It is proper and right to hymn You, to bless You, to praise You, to give thanks to You, and to worship You in every place of Your dominion. For You, O God, are ineffable, inconceivable, invisible, incomprehensible, existing forever, forever the same, You and Your only-begotten Son and Your Holy Spirit. You brought us out of nothing into being, and when we had fallen away, You raised us up again. You left nothing undone until you had led us up to heaven and granted us Your Kingdom, which is to come. For all these things, we thank You and Your only-begotten Son and Your Holy Spirit: for all things we know and do not know, for blessings manifest and hidden that have been bestowed on us. We thank You also for this Liturgy, which You have deigned to receive from our hands, even though thousands of archangels and tens of thousands of angels stand around You, the Cherubim and Seraphim, six-winged, many-eyed, soaring aloft upon their wings,

And he exclaims:

Singing the triumphal hymn, exclaiming, proclaiming, and saying…

**People:** Holy, holy, holy, Lord Sabaoth, heaven and earth are filled with Your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.

Priest (in a low voice): Together with these blessed powers, Master, Who loves mankind, we also exclaim and say: Holy are You and most holy, You and Your only-begotten Son and Your Holy Spirit. Holy are You and most holy, and sublime is Your glory. You so loved Your world that You gave Your only-begotten Son so that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life. When He had come and fulfilled for our sake the entire plan of salvation, on the night in which He was delivered up, or rather when He delivered Himself up for the life of the world, He took bread in His holy, pure, and blameless hands, and, giving thanks and blessing, He hallowed and broke it, and gave it to His holy disciples and apostles, saying:

The Priest exclaims:

Take, eat, this is My Body, which is broken for you for the remission of sins.

**People:** Amen.

The Priest then says in a low voice:

Likewise, after partaking of the supper, He took the cup, saying,

The Priest again exclaims:

Drink of this, all of you; this is My Blood of the new covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the remission of sins.

**People:** Amen.

Then the Priest says in a low voice:

Remembering, therefore, this saving commandment and all that has been done for our sake: the Cross, the tomb, the Resurrection on the third day, the Ascension into heaven, the enthronement at the right hand, and the second and glorious coming again.

And he exclaims:

Your own of Your own we offer to You, in all and for all.

**People:** We praise You, we bless You, we give thanks to You, and we pray to You, Lord our God.

Priest (in a low voice): Once again we offer to You this spiritual worship without the shedding of blood, and we beseech and pray and entreat You: Send down Your Holy Spirit upon us and upon the gifts here presented,

The Deacon, gesturing with his orarion toward the holy Bread, says:

Bless, Master, the Holy Bread.

And the Priest blesses over the holy Bread and says:

And make this bread the precious Body of Your Christ.

The Deacon, gesturing with his orarion toward the holy Chalice, says:

Amen. Bless, Master, the holy Cup.

The Priest, blessing over the holy Chalice, says:

And that which is in this Cup, the precious Blood of Your Christ.

The Deacon, gesturing with his orarion toward both Holy Gifts, says:

Amen. Bless, Master, both the Holy Gifts.

The Priest, blessing both the Holy Bread and holy Chalice, says:

Changing them by Your Holy Spirit.

**Deacon:** Amen. Amen. Amen.

The Priest says in a low voice:

So that they may be for those who partake of them for vigilance of soul, remission of sins, communion of Your Holy Spirit, fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven, boldness before You, not for judgment or condemnation. Again, we offer You this spiritual worship for those who have reposed in the faith: forefathers, fathers, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, preachers, evangelists, martyrs, confessors, ascetics, and for every righteous spirit made perfect in faith,

And he exclaims:

Especially for our most holy, pure, blessed, and glorious Lady, the Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary.

**People:** It is truly right to bless you, Theotokos, ever blessed, most pure, and Mother of our God. More honorable than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Logos. We magnify you, the true Theotokos.

The Priest says in a low voice:

For Saint John the prophet, forerunner, and baptist; for the holy, glorious, and most praiseworthy apostles; for Saint(s) (Name), whose memory we celebrate; and for all Your saints, through whose supplications, visit us, O God. And remember all who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection to life eternal (here the Priest commemorates by name those departed whom he wishes). Grant them rest, O our God, where the light of Your countenance keeps watch. Again we beseech You, Lord, remember all Orthodox bishops who rightly teach the word of Your truth, the presbyterate, the diaconate in Christ, and every priestly and monastic order. Again we offer You this spiritual worship for the whole world, for the holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, and for those living pure and reverent lives. For civil authorities and our armed forces, grant that they may govern in peace, Lord, so that in their tranquility we, too, may live calm and serene lives, in all piety and virtue.

And he exclaims:

Among the first remember, Lord, our Archbishop (Name); grant him to Your holy churches in peace, safety, honor, and health, unto length of days, rightly teaching the word of Your truth.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

The Deacon, facing the people, exclaims:

And remember those whom each one of us has in mind, and all the people.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

The Priest prays the following prayer in a low voice:

Remember, Lord, this city in which we live, and every city and land, and the faithful who live in them. Remember, Lord, those who travel by land, sea, and air; the sick; the suffering; the captives; and their salvation. Remember those who bear fruit and do good works in Your holy churches and those who are mindful of the poor, and upon us all send forth Your mercies.

And he exclaims:

And grant that with one voice and one heart we may glorify and praise Your most honorable and majestic name, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

**Priest:** And the mercies of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, be with you all.

**People:** And with your spirit.

The people respond with Lord, have mercy, after each petition.

**Deacon:** Having commemorated all the saints, again and again, in peace, let us pray to the Lord.

For the precious Gifts here presented and consecrated, let us pray to the Lord.

That our God Who loves mankind, having accepted them at His holy and celestial and mystical altar as an offering of spiritual fragrance, may in return send down upon us the divine grace and the gift of the Holy Spirit, let us pray.

For our deliverance from all affliction, wrath, danger, and necessity, let us pray to the Lord.

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and protect us, O God, by Your grace.

That the whole day may be perfect, holy, peaceful, and sinless, let us ask the Lord.

The people respond with Grant this, O Lord, after each petition.

For an angel of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of our souls and bodies, let us ask the Lord.

For pardon and remission of our sins and transgressions, let us ask the Lord.

For that which is good and beneficial for our souls, and for peace for the world, let us ask the Lord.

That we may complete the remaining time of our life in peace and repentance, let us ask the Lord.

And let us ask for a Christian end to our life, peaceful, without shame and suffering, and for a good defense before the awesome judgment seat of Christ.

**Deacon:** Having asked for the unity of the faith and for the communion of the Holy Spirit, let us commend ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

**People:** To You, O Lord.

**Priest (in a low voice):** We entrust to You, loving Master, our whole life and hope, and we beseech, pray, and implore You: Grant us to partake of Your heavenly and awesome Mysteries from this sacred and spiritual table with a clear conscience for the remission of sins, the forgiveness of transgressions, the communion of the Holy Spirit, the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven, and boldness before You, not unto judgment or condemnation.

**And he exclaims:**

And grant us, Master, with boldness and without condemnation, to dare call You, the heavenly God, Father, and to say:

**The Clergy and the People:**

## The Lord’s Prayer
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

**Priest:** For Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

**Priest:** Peace be with all.

**People:** And with your spirit.

**Deacon:** Let us bow our heads to the Lord.

**People:** To You, O Lord.

**Priest (in a low voice):** We give thanks to You, invisible King, Who by Your boundless power fashioned the universe, and in the multitude of Your mercy brought all things from nothing into being. Look down from heaven, O Master, upon those who have bowed their heads before You; for they have not bowed before flesh and blood, but before You, the awesome God. Therefore, O Master, make smooth and beneficial for us all, whatever lies ahead, according to the need of each: Sail with those who sail; travel with those who travel; heal the sick, Physician of our souls and bodies.

And he exclaims:

Through the grace, compassion, and love for mankind of Your only-begotten Son, with whom You are blessed, together with Your all-holy, good, and life-creating Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

The Holy Communion
Priest (in a low voice): Hearken, O Lord Jesus Christ our God, from Your holy dwelling place and from the throne of glory of Your Kingdom, and come to sanctify us, You Who are enthroned with the Father on high and are present among us invisibly here. And with Your mighty hand, grant Communion of Your most pure Body and precious Blood to us, and through us to all the people.

**Deacon:** Let us be attentive!

**Priest:** The Holy Gifts for the holy people of God.

**People:** One is Holy, one is Lord, Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father. Amen.

Then the Communion Hymn is chanted:

Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise Him in the highest. Alleluia. (3)

After the Deacon exclaims Let us be attentive, he enters through the south door into the holy Altar. Standing to the right of the Priest, he addresses him, saying:

Apportion, Master, the Holy Bread.

The Priest, dividing the Holy Bread into four pieces, says:

The Lamb of God is apportioned and distributed; apportioned, but not divided; ever eaten, yet never consumed; but sanctifying those who partake.

And the Deacon, pointing toward the holy Chalice, says:

Fill, Master, the holy Cup.

The Priest, taking the ΙΣ piece, makes the Sign of the Cross above the holy Chalice, saying:

The fullness of the Holy Spirit.

He then places the ΙΣ piece in the holy Chalice.

**Deacon:** Amen.

The Deacon, taking the zeon, addresses the **Priest:**

Bless, Master, the zeon.

The Priest, blessing the zeon, says:

Blessed is the fervor of Your saints, always, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**Deacon:** Amen.

The Deacon pours from the zeon the needed amount into the holy Chalice, saying:

The fervor of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

It is customary for the Priest and Deacon to offer the following prayers of Holy Communion.

I believe and confess, Lord, that You are truly the Christ, the Son of the living God, Who came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the first. I also believe that this is truly Your pure Body and that this is truly Your precious Blood. Therefore, I pray to You, have mercy upon me, and forgive my transgressions, voluntary and involuntary, in word and deed, in knowledge or in ignorance. And make me worthy, without condemnation, to partake of Your pure Mysteries for the remission of sins and for eternal life. Amen.

Behold, I approach for Divine Communion.
O Maker, burn me not as I partake,
For You are fire consuming the unworthy.
But cleanse me from every stain.

O Son of God, receive me today as a partaker of Your mystical supper. For I will not speak of the mystery to Your enemies, nor will I give You a kiss, as did Judas. But like the thief, I confess to You: Remember me, Lord, in Your Kingdom.

Tremble, O man, as you behold the divine Blood.
It is a burning coal that sears the unworthy.
The Body of God both deifies and nourishes me:
It deifies the Spirit and wondrously nourishes the mind.

You have smitten me with yearning, O Christ, and by Your divine eros You have changed me. But burn up with spiritual fire my sins, and grant me to be filled with delight in You, so that, leaping for joy, I may magnify, O Good One, Your two comings.

How shall I, who am unworthy, enter into the splendor of Your saints? If I should dare to enter into the bridal chamber, my vesture will condemn me, since it is not a wedding garment; and being bound up, I shall be cast out by the angels. Cleanse, O Lord, the filth of my soul, and save me, as You are the one Who loves mankind. In Your love, Lord, cleanse my soul, and save me.

Master Who loves mankind, Lord Jesus Christ, my God, let not these Holy Gifts be to my judgment because I am unworthy, but rather for the purification and sanctification of both soul and body and the pledge of the life and Kingdom to come. It is good for me to cleave unto God and to place in Him the hope of my salvation.

O Son of God, receive me today as a partaker of Your mystical supper. For I will not speak of the mystery to Your enemies, nor will I give You a kiss, as did Judas. But like the thief, I confess to You: Remember me, Lord, in Your Kingdom.

The Priest prepares to receive Holy Communion.

Behold, I approach Christ, our immortal King and God. Unto me, (Name), the unworthy presbyter, is imparted the precious and all-holy Body of our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the remission of my sins and life eternal.

He communes of the Holy Bread with fear and with great care. Then he says to the **Deacon:**

Deacon, approach.

And the Deacon approaches at the Priest’s right, extending his hands with his right palm crossed over his left, saying:

Behold, I approach Christ, our immortal King and God. Impart, Master, to me, (Name), the unworthy deacon, the precious and all-holy Body of our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the remission of my sins and life eternal.

The Priest places a piece of the Holy Bread in the Deacon’s right palm, saying:

Unto you, (Name), the most devout deacon, is imparted the precious and all-holy Body of our Lord and God and Savior Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and life eternal.

The Deacon kisses the right hand of the Priest, steps behind the holy Table, and communes of the Holy Bread.

The Priest, with the communion cloth in his hand, takes the holy Chalice, saying:

Again unto me, (Name), the unworthy presbyter, is imparted the precious and all-holy and life-giving Blood of our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the remission of my sins and life eternal.

He communes once from the holy Chalice in silence. Then he says:

This has touched my lips, and the Lord takes away all my iniquities and cleanses my sins.

He calls the Deacon again, saying:

Deacon, approach again.

The Deacon approaches at the Priest’s left, saying:

As I approach again, Master, impart to me, (Name), the unworthy deacon, the precious and all-holy and life-giving Blood of our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the remission of my sins and life eternal.

The Priest communes him from the holy Chalice, saying:

Again to you, (Name), the most devout deacon, is imparted the precious and all-holy and life-giving Blood of our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins and life eternal.

The Deacon wipes his lips and the holy Chalice with the communion cloth, then kisses the holy Chalice and the hand of the Priest, who says::

This has touched your lips, and the Lord takes away all your iniquities and cleanses your sins.

Then the Deacon takes the holy Paten and, using the mousa (sponge), transfers the remaining portions of the Holy Body into the holy Chalice with attention and reverence.

It is customary for the Deacon to say the following at this time:

Having beheld the Resurrection of Christ, let us worship the holy Lord Jesus, the only sinless one. Your Cross, O Christ, we venerate, and Your holy Resurrection we praise and glorify. For You are our God; apart from You we know no other; we call upon Your name. Come, all faithful, let us venerate the holy Resurrection of Christ; for behold, through the Cross, joy has come to the whole world. Ever blessing the Lord, let us praise His Resurrection; for having endured the Cross for us, He destroyed death by death.

Shine, shine, O New Jerusalem, for the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you. Dance now and be glad, Zion, and you, O pure Theotokos, rejoice in the Resurrection of your Son.

O voice divine, beloved and most sweet! For you, O Christ, have promised in truth to be with us unto the close of the age, and we faithful rejoice, having this anchor of hope.

O Christ, our Pascha, most sacred and great: wisdom, Word, and power of God. Grant unto us to partake of You more profoundly in the unending day of Your Kingdom.

* * * * *

**After the Communion Hymn the Deacon exclaims:**

With the fear of God, faith, and love, draw near.

And the people receive Holy Communion.

The Priest receives the holy Chalice from the hands of the Deacon and begins communing the people, saying to each one:

The servant of God (Name) partakes of the Body and Blood of Christ for the remission of sins and life eternal.

**After all have communed, the Priest blesses the people, saying:**

Save, O God, Your people, and bless Your inheritance.

**People:** We have seen the true light; we have received the heavenly Spirit; we have found the true faith, worshiping the undivided Trinity, for the Trinity has saved us.

**Priest (in a low voice):** Wash away, Lord, by Your Holy Blood, the sins of Your servants here remembered through the intercessions of the Theotokos and all Your saints. Amen.

**Deacon (in a low voice):** Exalt, Master.

**Priest (in a low voice):** Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let Your glory be over all the earth. (3)

Blessed is our God,

And, facing the people, he exclaims:

Always, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

Let our mouths be filled with Your praise, O Lord, that we may sing of Your glory, because You have made us worthy to partake of Your Holy Mysteries. Keep us in Your sanctification, that all day long we may meditate upon Your righteousness. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia.

**Deacon:** Arise! Having partaken of the divine, holy, pure, immortal, heavenly, life-creating, and awesome Mysteries of Christ, let us worthily give thanks to the Lord.

Help us, save us, have mercy upon us, and protect us, O God, by Your grace.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

**Deacon:** Having prayed for a perfect, holy, peaceful, and sinless day, let us commend ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

**People:** To You, O Lord.

## The Thanksgiving Prayer
**Priest (in a low voice):** We give thanks to You, Master Who loves mankind, benefactor of our souls, that even on this very day You have made us worthy of Your heavenly and immortal Mysteries. Make straight our path, fortify us in Your fear, guard our life, make secure our steps, through the prayers and supplications of the glorious Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary and of all Your saints.

**And he exclaims:**

**People:** Amen.

**Priest:** Let us go forth in peace.

**Deacon:** Let us pray to the Lord.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

## The Prayer behind the Ambon
**Priest:** O Lord, Who blesses those who bless You and sanctifies those who put their trust in You, save Your people and bless Your inheritance. Protect the whole body of Your Church. Sanctify those who love the beauty of Your house. Glorify them in return by Your divine power, and forsake us not who have set our hope in You. Grant peace to Your world, to Your churches, to the clergy, to our civic leaders, to the armed forces, and to all Your people. For every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from You, the Father of lights. To You we give glory, thanksgiving, and worship, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and to the ages. (3)

Priest (in a low voice): Christ our God, You are the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets. You have fulfilled the Father’s entire plan of salvation. Fill our hearts with joy and gladness always, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

**Deacon:** Let us pray to the Lord.

**People:** Lord, have mercy.

**Priest:** May the blessing of the Lord and His mercy come upon you by His divine grace and love for mankind, always, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

**People:** Amen.

**Priest:** Glory to You, O God, glory to You.

**Priest:** May He Who rose from the dead,[^4] Christ our true God, through the intercessions of His all-pure and all-immaculate holy Mother; the power of the precious and life-giving Cross; the protection of the honorable, bodiless powers of heaven; the supplications of the honorable, glorious prophet and forerunner John the Baptist; of the holy, glorious, and praiseworthy apostles; of the holy, glorious, and triumphant martyrs; of our righteous and God-bearing fathers; of (name of the saint of the church); of our father among the saints John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople; of the holy and righteous ancestors of God Joachim and Anna; of (saint of the day), whose memory we celebrate today; and of all the saints; have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and loves mankind.

Offering the antidoron to the faithful, the Priest says:

May the blessing and the mercy of the Lord come upon you.

To the last person receiving the antidoron, he says:

By His divine grace and love for mankind, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

## The Thanksgiving After Holy Communion
The Deacon at the Prothesis consumes the Holy Gifts reverently and with absolute attention, saying:

### The Admonitory Verses
And when you obtain the blessed Communion,
of the life-creating mystical Gifts,
straightway give praise and great thanks,
and fervently from your soul say to God,
Glory to You, O God; glory to You,
O God; glory to You, O God.

**And immediately he offers the following prayers of thanksgiving:**

Anonymous
I thank You, O Lord my God, for You have not rejected me, a sinner, but have deemed me worthy to be a partaker of Your Holy Gifts. I thank You that You deemed me worthy, unworthy as I am, to partake of Your pure and heavenly Gifts. O Master, Who loves mankind, Who for us both died and arose and Who granted us these, Your dread and life-creating Mysteries, for the benefit and sanctification of our souls and bodies: Grant that these may be to me for the healing of both soul and body, for the averting of everything hostile, for the enlightenment of the eyes of my heart, for the peace of the powers of my soul, for faith unashamed, for love unfeigned, for the fullness of wisdom, for the observance of Your commandments, for an increase of Your divine grace, and for abiding in Your Kingdom; that being kept by them in Your holiness I may ever be mindful of Your grace, and no longer live for myself but for You, our Master and benefactor. And thus, when from this life I have passed in the hope of life eternal, may I attain to everlasting rest, where the sound of those who celebrate is unceasing, and unending is the delight of those who behold the ineffable beauty of Your Countenance. For You are, indeed, the true object of our desire and the inexpressible gladness of those who love You, O Christ our God, and all creation praises You unto the ages. Amen.

## The Prayer of St. Basil the Great
O Master Christ, our God, King of the ages and creator of all, I thank You for all the good things You have granted me and for the Communion of Your pure and life-giving Mysteries. I beseech You, therefore, O Good One Who loves mankind, keep me under Your protection and in the shadow of Your wings; and grant that, with a clear conscience and until my final breath, I may worthily partake of Your Holy Gifts for the remission of my sins and for life eternal. For You are the bread of life, the well-spring of holiness, and the giver of all that is good, and to You we ascribe the glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

## The Prayer of St. Symeon the Metaphrastes
(The Translator)
O You Who willingly grant me Your Flesh for food, You are a fire, and You consume the unworthy! Burn me not, O my Maker, But rather pass through my composite members Into all my joints, my innermost core, and my heart.

Burn up the thorns of all my transgressions; Purify my soul; sanctify my thoughts; Make firm my legs, as well as my bones; Illumine the clarity of my five senses; Nail down the whole of me by Your fear. Ever overshadow, watch, and guard me from every soul-destroying act and word.

Purify, cleanse, and train me; Adorn, elucidate, and illuminate me; Show me to be the dwelling of Your Spirit alone, And no longer the dwelling of sin;

So that, as Your house, by the entrance of Communion As Fire, every evildoer and passion may flee, I bring to You intercessors, all the sanctified, The captains of the bodiless angels, Your Forerunner, the wise apostles, And to them I add Your pure, immaculate Mother. Receive, O my compassionate Christ, their petitions, And make of your hired servant a child of light!

For You are alone our sanctification, O Good One, and the brightness of our souls; And to You, as is fitting, as our God and Master, Do we all ascribe glory from day to day.

Anonymous
May Your holy Body, O Lord Jesus Christ, our God, be to me for life eternal, and Your precious Blood for remission of sins. And may this Eucharist be to me for joy, health, and gladness. And at Your awesome Second Coming, deem me, the sinner, worthy to stand at the right hand of Your glory, through the intercessions of Your all-pure Mother and all Your saints. Amen.

To the Most Holy Theotokos
All-holy Lady, Theotokos, the light of my darkened soul, my hope and protection, my refuge and consolation, and my joy, I thank you that you have made me worthy, though I am unworthy, to partake of the pure Body and precious Blood of your Son. But as the one who gave birth to the true Light: enlighten the noetic eyes of my heart. You who conceived the source of immortality, give life to me, dead in sin. You who are the compassionately loving Mother of the merciful God, have mercy on me and give my heart compunction and contrition, humility in my thoughts, and release from my captive thoughts. And make me worthy until my final breath to receive without condemnation the sanctification of the pure Mysteries for the healing of both soul and body. And grant me tears of repentance and confession, that I may praise and glorify you all the days of my life. For you are blessed and glorified unto the ages. Amen.

**Priest:** Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word; for my eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all peoples, a light to bring revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel.

The Trisagion Prayers and the Apolytikion of the Day
The Apolytikion for St. John Chrysostom
The grace that shone forth like a torch from your mouth illumined the universe. It laid up for the world the treasures of freedom from avarice. It showed us the height of humility. But while instructing us by your words, Father John Chrysostom, intercede with the Word, Christ, our God, that our souls be saved.

The Kontakion for the Day and for St. John Chrysostom
You received divine grace from heaven, and through your lips you teach us all to worship the one God in Trinity, all-blessed, venerable John Chrysostom. Rightly we praise you, for you are a teacher who makes clear the things divine.

And the following:

The Church was revealed to be a many-lighted heaven, which illuminates all of the faithful; standing in it, we cry aloud: O Lord, make firm this house.

**Priest:** Glory to You, O God, glory to You.

May He Who rose from the dead,[^5] Christ our true God, through the intercessions of His all-pure and all-immaculate holy Mother; of the holy, glorious, and praiseworthy apostles; of (name of the saint of the parish); of our father among the saints John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople; and of all the saints; have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and loves mankind.

Through the prayers of our holy fathers, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, have mercy on us.

**Deacon:** Amen.

Then both the Deacon and the Priest wash their hands and lips in the special drain in the holy Altar, divest themselves of their clerical vestments, and venerate and kiss the holy Table. They then exit the holy Altar, giving thanks to the Lord.

*This Marks the End of the Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom.*

[^1] If no Deacon serves, everything is said by the Priest from within the holy Altar (except Master give the blessing, Master give the direction, etc., and all dialogues between the Priest and Deacon).

[^2] The people chant together with the choir and chanters.

[^3] When there are many concelebrants, they exchange the kiss of peace and then kiss each other’s right hands; the first Priest says Christ is in our midst, and the next Priest responds He is and always shall be.

[^4] He who rose from the dead is used if it is a Sunday or during the Paschal season; it may be replaced by the designated dismissal for the specific dominical feast. If none of these applies, then simply May Christ our true God is said.

[^5] He who rose from the dead is used if it is a Sunday or during the Paschal season; it may be replaced by the designated dismissal for the specific dominical feast. If none of these applies, then simply May Christ our true God is said.
